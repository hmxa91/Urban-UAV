### INTRODUCTION

  If drivers were to take to the
skies in significant numbers, the congestion would
become dangerous. Flying cars will continue to
service small niche markets until they can be truly
integrated into the national airspace.
To achieve the kind of transportation breakthrough
that will lead to a plane in every driveway,
we must let go of our need for control and let the
plane do the flying for us. Personal and commercial
air vehicles will have to be more like unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones.

### CUSTOM DESIGN

Since the Avionic suite in drones is designed by expert
engineers, this opensource code with it easy to use
interface allows the customer/ user to design the
structure of the drone/ aerial vehicle as
they deem fit. An effective tool
to design your very own future drone.

### DREAM TO REALITY

The submitted design is later analyzed by our aerospace
engineers and with a few minor changes we send it for
manufacturing at our local drone factory.

### COST

Minimum cost incurred for a custom UAV can range between
1.5 to 2.5 million Rupees (15 - 25 lakh rupees)

### CODE DETAILS

Initially the code was written by NASA
